                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Soil Health:</span>
                    Organic farming starts with the soil. We prioritize soil health through natural practices like crop rotation, cover cropping, and composting. Healthy soil means nutrient-rich produce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Biodiversity:</span>
                    Our farms are vibrant ecosystems. We encourage diverse plant species, beneficial insects, and wildlife. Biodiversity enhances resilience and reduces the need for chemical interventions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Natural Pest Control:</span>
                    Instead of harsh pesticides, we rely on nature’s allies. Ladybugs, lacewings, and other beneficial insects keep pests in check. It’s a delicate balance that works wonders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Chemical-Free Inputs:</span>
                    Our fertilizers and pest control methods are organic. No synthetic chemicals harm the environment or end up in your food. It’s a win for both consumers and Mother Earth.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Crop Rotation:</span>
                    We rotate crops to prevent soil depletion and disease buildup. Different plants have different nutrient needs, and rotation maintains soil fertility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Water Conservation:</span>
                    Organic practices minimize water wastage. Mulching, efficient irrigation, and drought-resistant crops play their part.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-medium">Community Connection:</span>
